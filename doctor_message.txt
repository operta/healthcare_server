Dear patient,

Your test results for COVID-19 came back POSITIVE and I want you to take your time and read through the advice I will provide you with in the following text.

First and foremost, try to remain calm and understand the virus, so you know exactly what to do.
COVID-19 is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.
It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).

If your symptoms are mild, please take following action to get well as fast as possible and protect yourself and people around you:
You may continue to experience the typical symptoms which include a fever, cough and mild shortness of breath.  Most people with mild illness will start feeling better within a week of first symptoms. Get rest at home and drink enough water/ clear fluids during the day to make sure that your urine stays a pale clear colour.  There are no specific antiviral treatments recommended for coronavirus disease. You can take over-the-counter medications if you have fever or pain. Use these according to the instructions on the packet or label and do not exceed the recommended dose. You should continue taking any other prescribed chronic medication.

Monitor your symptoms carefully. If your symptoms get worse, call your healthcare provider immediately. If you develop any emergency warning signs, get medical attention immediately. Emergency warning signs include: trouble breathing, chest pain or pressure in your chest that does not go away, coughing up blood, becoming confused, severe sleepiness, blue lips or face.  If you have any warning signs, you or a member of your household should call your nearest hospital or emergency services immediately and notify them that you have confirmed coronavirus disease. 

Take care!


Best,
CoronaCare Team
